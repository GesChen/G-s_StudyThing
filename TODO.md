## Todo:
 - [ ] Settings for different features
   - [ ] colors
   - [ ] audio
   - [ ] overall speed (animations, transitions, etc)
 - [ ] smooth animations and transitions

## In Progress:
 - [ ] typing mode
   - [ ] smart grader, uses closeness and threshold settings to compensate for typing errors
   - [ ] threshold where grader will confirm if the intended answer was the correct one, below both thresholds the answer would be incorrect
   
## Done:
 - [ ] Main functionality
 - [ ] mathing/selections mode
 - [ ] set importing
 - [ ] set randomizer (create duplicate of set snd shuffle after iteration?)
 - [ ] Automatic switching after correct answer


### Ideas:
 - automatic importing given URL (403 issues ahead)
 - test mode
 - more game modes
 - set library with lots of autoimported sets
 - custom set maker
 - custom set export and importing
