## Todo: 
 - [ ] round counter
 - [ ] Settings for different features
   - [ ] colors
   - [ ] audio
   - [ ] overall speed (animations, transitions, etc)
 - [ ] smooth animations and transitions
 - [ ] gradient images (somehow)
 - [ ] fix main menu set preview scroll (custom system?)

## In Progress:
 - [ ] fix importing from clipboard (multine defs) and have some way to manually or automatically configure multiline defs

## Done:
 - [ ] Main functionality
 - [ ] mathing/selections mode
 - [ ] set importing
 - [ ] set randomizer (create duplicate of set snd shuffle after iteration?)
 - [ ] Automatic switching after correct answer
 - [ ] typing mode
   - [ ] smart grader, uses closeness and threshold settings to compensate for typing errors
   - [ ] threshold where grader will confirm if the intended answer was the correct one, below both thresholds the answer would be incorrect

### Ideas:
 - automatic importing given URL (403 issues ahead)
 - test mode
 - more game modes
 - set library with lots of autoimported sets
 - custom set maker
 - custom set export and importing

### On hold:
 - importing from file - doesn't work because the entire set isn't where i thought, might try again later
